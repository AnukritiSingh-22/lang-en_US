READ THIS FILE WHEN YOU WANT TO MAKE TRANSLATIONS TO ANOTHER LANGUAGE
=====================================================================

 Unraid version 6.9.0

=====================================================================

There are eleven text files included in this ZIP archive, each with their own section of translations:

 - translations.txt -- these are general translations and loaded each time
 - dashboard.txt    -- these are translations for the dashboard section
 - main.txt         -- these are translations for the main section
 - shares.txt       -- these are translations for the shares section
 - users.txt        -- these are translations for the users section
 - settings.txt     -- these are translations for the settings section
 - plugins.txt      -- these are translations for the plugins section
 - docker.txt       -- these are translations for the docker section
 - vms.txt          -- these are translations for the vms section
 - tools.txt        -- these are translations for the tools section
 - javascript.txt   -- these are translations for javascript scripts

All file names are in lowercase and should be included in the ZIP archive to make the translations complete.
Removing a particular file, means no translations will be available for that section and the GUI will display text in original english.

Use this ZIP archive as your source and save modifications and translations in a different ZIP archive!


TRANSLATIONS
============
Each text file contains regular text strings stored in UTF-8 format with linux line-endings.
Use a text editor which supports UTF-8 and linux format, like notepad++ (see https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads)

The content of each text file is separated into two parts

PART 1
------
These are single line entries which are in the format:

    original english text=translated foreign text

Only modify the text after the equal sign(=) and leave the original english text at the left untouched.
Removing a line or omitting a translation after the equal sign, results in the GUI displaying this line with the original english text.

The translated text may have 'special characters', such as slashes, parenthesis or brackets which are not included in the key text,
but which are used to display text accordingly. E.g.

    Bar color - Text=Bar (color) - Text

The characters '*' and '**' are used to display text in italics and bold respectively. E.g.

    Array must be Stopped to change=Array must be **Stopped** to change

It is recommended to make translations per section, that is one file at the time, and verify the correctness of the translations in the GUI
before proceeding with the next section.

Keep in mind the length of the translations and try to make them similar length as the original text and avoid space issues in the GUI.

PART 2
------
These are multi line entries used to translate multiple lines at once.
Multi line translations have a unique opening and closing tag:

:helpXX - unique opening tag used for the built-in help text
:plugXX - unique opening tag used for any multi line text section
:end    - closing tag

Do not remove or alter these tags and only translate the text between the opening and closing tags!

Help text is written in Markdown style, translations must follow the same style, e.g. lines starting with a '>' must be obeyed.
The built-in help text is very extensive, you may want to opt to leave this as original english, this is entirely optional.


PREPARATION
===========
Once the translations are complete or you want to test the intermediate results, the text files (minus this file) need to be zipped into a single ZIP file.
Give the ZIP file the name of your language, e.g. French.zip.

In the GUI go to: Tools -> webGUI -> Language.
 - By default only the English language is installed (built-in)
 - Choose the ZIP file you have created earlier as the source file
 - If the language name is recognized, it will be automatically selected, otherwise chose the name of the language from the dropdown menu to install.
 - Click on "Upload" will add your translations to the GUI under the selected language name

NOTE: If your language is not available from the dropdown menu, please make a request on the Unraid forum (see https://forums.unraid.net)

Now your language is available to be used!

In the GUI go to: Settings -> Display Settings -> Language
 - Select the preferred language from the dropdown menu. Note that only the available language choices are displayed here.

Test your efforts!


UPDATES
=======
A language section will be made available at the Unraid forum (see https://forums.unraid.net) where translators can put their work
and allow other users to download and install their preferred language.

When updated text files become available in the future with revised translations, the changes will be indicated as follows

lines starting with + are either modified or newly added lines. A updated/new translation is required here
lines starting with - are not used any longer. This line can be removed from the translation file


CREDITS
=========
Your efforts are much welcomed and to show our appreciation, your name and language are credited on the Credits page under Tools in the GUI.
Do not forget to change "NAME" and "LANGUAGE" in the 'credits' file.

Thank you very much!
